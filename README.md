## Projects

### Project 1: OTP Generator (./Project_1_OTP Generator)

# OTP Generator

**Overview:**
The OTP Generator project is a Java-based system designed to create and validate One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for enhanced security, particularly in two-factor authentication (2FA) scenarios. It provides functionality to generate random OTPs with customizable settings and ensures their validity within a specified time period.

**Features:**
- **Random OTP Generation:** Creates OTPs of configurable lengths (e.g., 4, 6, 8 digits).
- **Configurable OTP Length:** Users can set the desired length for the OTP.
- **Alphanumeric Support:** Option to include both letters and digits in the OTP.
- **Validity Period:** Defines an expiration time for each OTP.
- **Logging:** Basic logging to track OTP generation and usage.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Java:** Core programming language for OTP generation and validation.
- **Maven:** Build automation and dependency management.
- **JUnit 5:** Testing framework for unit tests.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Integrated development environment (IDE) for coding, with Java Extension Pack and Test Runner for Java.

### Project 2: Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game is a Java-based application designed for players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It also tracks the number of attempts and offers the player an option to start a new game after guessing correctly.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java**: The programming language used to build the game.
- **Random**: Utilized for generating a random number between 1 and 100.
- **Scanner**: Used to capture user input.

### Key Features:
- Random number generation within a specified range.
- Real-time feedback on guesses.
- Attempt tracking and replayability options.

To run the game, clone the repository, compile the Java file, and execute the program.
