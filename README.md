## Projects

### Project 1: OTP Generator (./Project_1_OTP Generator)

# OTP Generator

**Overview:**
The OTP Generator project is a Java-based system designed to create and validate One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for enhanced security, particularly in two-factor authentication (2FA) scenarios. It provides functionality to generate random OTPs with customizable settings and ensures their validity within a specified time period.

**Features:**
- **Random OTP Generation:** Creates OTPs of configurable lengths (e.g., 4, 6, 8 digits).
- **Configurable OTP Length:** Users can set the desired length for the OTP.
- **Alphanumeric Support:** Option to include both letters and digits in the OTP.
- **Validity Period:** Defines an expiration time for each OTP.
- **Logging:** Basic logging to track OTP generation and usage.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Java:** Core programming language for OTP generation and validation.
- **Maven:** Build automation and dependency management.
- **JUnit 5:** Testing framework for unit tests.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Integrated development environment (IDE) for coding, with Java Extension Pack and Test Runner for Java.

### Project 2: Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game is a Java-based application designed for players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It also tracks the number of attempts and offers the player an option to start a new game after guessing correctly.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java**: The programming language used to build the game.
- **Random**: Utilized for generating a random number between 1 and 100.
- **Scanner**: Used to capture user input.

### Key Features:
- Random number generation within a specified range.
- Real-time feedback on guesses.
- Attempt tracking and replayability options.

To run the game, clone the repository, compile the Java file, and execute the program.

### Project 3: Brick Breaker Game

The Brick Breaker Game is a classic arcade-style game where players use a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty, various power-ups, and a scoring system to track player progress. It is developed using Java and the Swing framework for its graphical interface.

### Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language for game logic and functionality.
- **Swing**: Java’s built-in library for creating the graphical user interface.

The project includes:
- **Main.java**: Entry point for the game.
- **GamePanel.java**: Manages the game display and interactions.
- **Paddle.java**: Handles the paddle's movement and behavior.
- **Ball.java**: Manages ball movement and collision detection.
- **Brick.java**: Represents the bricks and their interactions with the ball.

The game can be run on any system with Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

### Project 4: ATM Simulation System

### Project Introduction:

The **ATM Simulation System** is a console-based Java application that simulates basic functionalities of an ATM machine. Designed for educational purposes, this project allows users to interact with a simulated ATM to perform common banking tasks. It emphasizes core Java programming concepts such as object-oriented design, exception handling, and file operations, providing a hands-on learning experience for students or developers working on Java applications.

### Features:

- **User Authentication**: Secure login using a predefined PIN.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Displays the current account balance.
- **Cash Withdrawal**: Enables withdrawal of funds with appropriate checks.
- **Deposit Funds**: Allows users to deposit money into their account.
- **Transaction History**: Provides a view of past transactions for review.

### Technology Used:

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Development Kit**: Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- **Development Environment**: Text editors or IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
- **Version Control**: Git for cloning and managing the project
